taskDescription: 'Create a class Point and a class Rectangle. The Point should hold coordinates X and Y and the Rectangle should hold 2 Points â€“ its bottom left and top right corners. In the Rectangle class, you should implement a contains(Point point) method that returns true or false, based on whether the Point given as attribute is inside or outside of the Rectangle object. Points on the side of a Square are considered inside.'
